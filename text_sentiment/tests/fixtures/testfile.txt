This is line one.
My second line.
Third line is the charm.
Fourth one fits the bill.
Fifth always works.
Sixth is not a problem at all.
Seventh for good luck!


When I was very young like in 2nd grade we were reading the classic "when you give a mouse a cookie" at the end of the book our teacher handed out tiny little cookie stickers about the size of a dime.
Now being the attention seeking little kid I was I crumpled it up into a ball and put it in my ear, to show my friends. After showing them I attempted to take it out, but my pudgy little fingers only managed to shove it farther back into my ear. I started to panic because I couldn't get it out, I didnt want to tell my teacher because I thought she would be mad so I spent an entire school day with a sticker up my ear.
When I got home I was scared to tell my parents because I thought I would get in trouble, so later on I snuck upstairs and grabbed my moms tweasers. I was trying to dig around in my ear and once again managed to shove it farther in, now you couldnt even see it in a mirror. Abandoning the tweasers I eventually forgot about it.
Four years later I had completely forgot about what happened. One day my ear was in a lot of pain for about a week, eventually my parents decided to bring me to a doctor because they thought I had an ear infection. Now I forget what the doctor did but eventually he decided there was something blocking my ear passage, they had to do a small operation and just use some bendy tweaser thing to pull out whatever it was. After a lot of pain he pulled out a paperish ball covered in ear wax. I was like WTF, then he uncrumpled it and I realized it was a cookie sticker. Everything came rushing back to me. The doctor and my mom were asking questions about how it got there and I just completely poker faced and said I had no idea. I havent told anyone that story ever, and I have no idea

I know this young kid who was convinced to thickly coat all of his hair with roofing tar. It was the kind really gooey tar that is used for sealing holes in roofs, loaded with kerosene and pitch black and all. The kid was somehow convinced it could be washed out with plain water. he gets a flat piece of stick and really smears on a thick coat, so thick it looks like some kind of heavy helmet.
Well when I arrived home and my parents looked at me they completely freaked out and proceeded to wash my hair with anything reasonably safe (even tried Jeyes Fluid for a bit). Having no luck with anything I was subjected repeatedly to a thorough kerosene shampoo. Now anyone who knows tar also knows it leaves behind a wickedly black stain on ones' skin. Realizing they just couldn't get it all out they dragged me to a barbour who proceeded to remove as much hair as he could with scissors, then a pair of electric clippers which he had to rinse in kerosene regularly to keep the blades moving, then a complete head shave. The stain? Well that just wouldn't come out right away so I was sent home with this incredible dark brown skin tone which matched my hairline perfectly. I was like this for more than a week, and as my hair grew back it had a strange hue to it for awhile too. (my normal hair color was blond). TL/DR Tarred not feathered. Crown of brown. Was young and fuelish.
